            <p>Ethically sourced dog food, to keep our furry friends healthy! <br>
                And to help them catch all the squirrels in the park.
                <br> Our products are paw-chosen by our in-house canine friend, Scarlet.
                <br> Since they are picked by a real dog, you know they are the best and healthiest treats!

            <h3> Scarlet was adopted from the animal shelter at 1 year, 8 months old.</h3> <br> 
            <p>She was given up by her old owners, but not much else is known about
                Scarlet's past.
                <br>
                She was taken to her new home while she had pneumonia, so she needed a lot of antibiotics.
                <br>
                After about a weeks time though, she beat it, and was ready to be a dog again!
                <br>
                Now she enjoys her time going on plenty of walks, and having lots of treats!
                <br>
                She also likes the beach and the park a lot. But no squirrels or cats are allowed past her.
